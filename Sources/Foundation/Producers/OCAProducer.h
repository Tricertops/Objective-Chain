/*! Producer is abstract class that produces values for Consumers.
 *  Concrete implementations include Timer, Notificator, Property, Command and custom subclasses can be implemented as well.
 *  It is responsibility of each Producer to manage its lifetime, so there is usually no need to retain it.
 *  Usually, you only need to create the Producer and use the Chaining methods listed below.

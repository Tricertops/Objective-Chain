Objective-Chain
===============

Object-oriented reactive framework written in **Objective-C**, that abstracts _production_, _transformation_ and _consumption_ of values in a declarative way. Project is inspired by [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa), but takes more object-oriented approach.

Aim is to build reusable and scalable solution for **MVVM** bindings.
